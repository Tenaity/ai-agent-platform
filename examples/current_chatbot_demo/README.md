# Current Chatbot Demo Reference Project

This directory is a **reference project** that documents how the SNP AI Agent
Platform scaffold applies to the user's current customer-service chatbot demo.
It is project structure, schemas, documentation, and deterministic local demo
wiring — not production runtime integration code.

The demo lives under `examples/` because this repository is a platform
framework, not a single chatbot implementation. Real production logic belongs in
`agents/` (versioned, testable, evaluable) once the wiring is validated here.

## Intended End-to-End Flow

```
Zalo (user sends message)
  → n8n workflow receives Zalo webhook event
  → n8n normalizes event into a platform RuntimeRequest
  → n8n calls Runtime API: POST /v1/agents/{agent_id}/invoke
  → Runtime API applies RequestIdMiddleware + InvocationService
  → InvocationService loads agent manifest + runs safety precheck
  → Agent graph executes:
      Safety precheck node
      → Intent routing node
      → RAG branch (in-memory fixtures now, future Qdrant retriever adapter)
          → RetrievalResult + CitationEnforcer
      → Tool branch (production-like mock API adapters)
          → ToolGateway policy check → executor → audit record
      → Answer formatting node
  → RuntimeResponse returned to n8n
  → n8n formats reply and sends back to Zalo user
```

See `architecture.md` for the full boundary diagram and node-level description.

## Telegram Local Demo

PR-022 adds `apps/telegram-worker`, a local long-polling worker for Telegram
BotFather bots. This is a demo ingress path that uses Telegram `getUpdates`,
normalizes text updates into `RuntimeRequest` payloads, calls the Runtime API,
and sends the answer back with `sendMessage`.

This mode is useful for local chatbot testing because it does not require
public HTTPS, a webhook endpoint, deployment, or production integrations.

Run the Runtime API and worker locally:

```bash
make run-runtime-api
make run-telegram-worker
```

See [Telegram local demo](../../docs/telegram-local-demo.md) for setup details.

## Agent Graph Shape (Reference)

The customer-service demo graph in `agents/customer_service/graph.py` now wires
this deterministic local shape:

```
Input
→ Safety precheck         (SafetyPipeline: rule-based + optional PII redaction)
→ Intent routing          (deterministic keyword rules)
→ RAG branch              (InMemoryRetriever fixtures → RetrievalResult + citations)
→ Tool branch             (mock API adapters → ToolGateway → audit)
→ Answer formatting       (CitationEnforcer when citations required)
→ RuntimeResponse
```

The example `agent/graph.py` remains a documentation sketch, while the runnable
demo graph lives under `agents/customer_service`. Tests use local fixtures and
the production-like mock API adapter only.

---

## Qdrant Retrieval (Future)

`qdrant/config.example.yaml` shows the retriever config fields needed by a
future Qdrant adapter implementing the platform `Retriever` interface.

`qdrant/payload_schema.example.json` shows the document payload shape expected
in the Qdrant collection (text, title, uri, source_id, doc_type, department,
effective_date, metadata).

The Qdrant adapter must return `RetrievalResult` objects. Answers relying on
retrieved context must pass through `CitationEnforcer` when citation policy is
active.

---

## Mock API Schemas And Adapter

`mock_api_schemas/` contains production-like request/response envelopes for:

- **container_tracking** — track a container by number
- **booking_status** — check booking confirmation status
- **support_ticket** — create a support ticket

All responses follow the platform envelope:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {},
  "error": null,
  "request_id": "mock-request-id"
}
```

PR-020 adds a deterministic local adapter in
`agents/customer_service/mock_api/`. It implements the platform `ToolExecutor`
interface for the customer-service tools without making external HTTP calls.
PR-021 composes it behind `ToolGateway`, `PolicyAwareToolExecutor`, and
`AuditAwareToolExecutor` inside the customer-service demo graph.

---

## n8n / Zalo Integration (Future)

`n8n/zalo_webhook_payload.example.json` shows the raw Zalo OA webhook event
shape that n8n receives from the Zalo platform.

`n8n/runtime_api_request.example.json` shows the normalized `RuntimeRequest`
that n8n constructs from the Zalo event before calling the Runtime API.

A future n8n/Zalo facade endpoint (PR-023) will keep the route handler thin and
delegate webhook normalization and validation to platform packages.

---

## What Is Not Implemented

- No real Qdrant adapter or Qdrant connection
- No real production API calls
- No real LLM calls
- No runtime route changes
- No database persistence
- No Docker deployment
- No webhook endpoint
- No n8n workflow wiring

Follow-up PRs can add each integration independently while keeping platform
packages reusable and route handlers thin.
